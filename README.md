# Mondrian Transcription Software

Hi there! This is a repository for Mondrian Transcription Software, an open-source tool to transcribe fine-grained movement data from video by efficiently tracing the movement of people or things over floor plan representations to generate text files of positioning data — essentially, a transcript of movement.

Mondrian Transcription features:

- **Browser-based:** Everything in your browser.
- **Movement transcription from video:** One of only a handful of tools built to manually transcribe movement from video.
- **Movement transcription at different scales:** Transcribe movement at the scale of gesture, classroom interaction, or larger scales.
- **Meaningful and efficient transcription:** Features such as fast-forwarding and re-winding provide meaningful and efficient ways to qualitatively transcribe movement data that are lost with automated methods.
- **Visualize movement transcription output:** Output data files can be visualized in software such as the [Interaction Geography Slicer](https://www.benrydal.com/software/igs).
- **Future features:** We are rapidly developing and expanding features and collaborators in this effort are welcome.
